## Overview of the project

### Project: REAL-TIME COLLABORATIVE DOCUMENT EDITOR.

### Objective:
This project is a web-based collaborative document editor that allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously in real time. Built with React.js on the frontend and Node.js with Socket.IO on the backend, it provides a seamless collaborative writing experience similar to tools like Google Docs.

### Key Features
**Real-Time Collaboration**

Multiple users can edit the same document at once.

Edits are synced instantly across all connected clients using WebSockets (Socket.IO).

**Unique Document Sessions**

Each session generates a unique document ID using uuid.

Users can join or create new document sessions dynamically.

**Persistent Data Storage**

Document content is stored in a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

Supports saving, loading, and auto-syncing documents.

**Change Propagation**

Edits are propagated in real-time to all clients viewing the same document.

Reduces conflicts by syncing the latest content continuously.

**Responsive and Clean UI**

Built with React and Tailwind CSS (or similar) for a modern editing interface.

Fully responsive for use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
